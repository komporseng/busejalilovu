"Our Sweet Angel Baby has gained her wings, Delaney Judith Krings. 12.16.2017 — 1.28.2023. Fly high, my sweet baby." Heather wrote on <a href=# rel=nofollow>CaringBridge,</a> where she has posted updates on her daughter's cancer fight since October 26.

"Pay some kindness forward in her name," Krings said. The mother of three continued by saying that the outpouring of love the family has received is a reflection of the love Delaney left behind. "Please know in your heart she's sharing a little bit of her love with you now, too, in the hopes that it helps you find light when it's dark, and find the love when you're sad," Krings added.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/meaww.com///d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/6e5ddc2d-b07f-416d-92aa-be7ad6fc9f71.jpg><p>Delaney was just four-year-old when she was diagnosed with a large, aggressive brain tumor. Her illness reportedly began with just an ear infection, that wouldn't go away. Her parents soon her took to a pediatrician, who did some CT scans before revealing that she has a tumor on both sides of her brain, <a href=# rel=nofollow>Daily Mail</a> reported. After leaving Delaney’s diagnosis, her parents decided to celebrate her life on her fifth and last birthday on 16 December.</p><p>Thousands around the world responded to Delaney’s heart-breaking story last year and decided to come together to organize a huge parade for her birthday. With appearances from Olaf, Elsa, and Mickey Mouse among others, the parade was the best gift for little Krings that her family could ever ask for. "It's amazing, and there are so many great people out there doing so much for us. You're really happy to see it, but you wish it wasn't your kid," said Jacob, Krings' father.</p><p>Before this special parade, a special card drive was also organized to celebrate Krings' final birthday. In a previous interview, Heather revealed that the family had already received "hundreds and hundreds" of letters all dedicated to the five-year-old. She added that in addition to cards, Krings also received Amazon packages and homemade items including blankets, bracelets, and ornaments.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRonJWhrq%2Bx2Gaiq6GenMBuw8ismqimo567brPIq6NmpJ%2BosrR5wZqrraSVYsSqwMdmmauZmaN6pK3NnJyrZZSWxrR5wJ%2Brnqpdpa6zrcOeZKimXZ2ys3mUrZ9mmpmnwamwwLI%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fdelaney-krings-wisconsin-girl-loses-battle-with-brain-cancer-days-after-parade-on-her-5th-birthday.html&text=%27Fly%20high%27%3a%20Wisconsin%20girl%20Delaney%20Krings%20dies%20from%20brain%20tumor%20days%20after%20thousands%20took%20out%20parade&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdelaney-krings-wisconsin-girl-loses-battle-with-brain-cancer-days-after-parade-on-her-5th-birthday.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdelaney-krings-wisconsin-girl-loses-battle-with-brain-cancer-days-after-parade-on-her-5th-birthday.html&title=%27Fly%20high%27%3a%20Wisconsin%20girl%20Delaney%20Krings%20dies%20from%20brain%20tumor%20days%20after%20thousands%20took%20out%20parade" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fdelaney-krings-wisconsin-girl-loses-battle-with-brain-cancer-days-after-parade-on-her-5th-birthday.html&title=%27Fly%20high%27%3a%20Wisconsin%20girl%20Delaney%20Krings%20dies%20from%20brain%20tumor%20days%20after%20thousands%20took%20out%20parade" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fdelaney-krings-wisconsin-girl-loses-battle-with-brain-cancer-days-after-parade-on-her-5th-birthday.html&title=%27Fly%20high%27%3a%20Wisconsin%20girl%20Delaney%20Krings%20dies%20from%20brain%20tumor%20days%20after%20thousands%20took%20out%20parade" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdelaney-krings-wisconsin-girl-loses-battle-with-brain-cancer-days-after-parade-on-her-5th-birthday.html&description=%27Fly%20high%27%3a%20Wisconsin%20girl%20Delaney%20Krings%20dies%20from%20brain%20tumor%20days%20after%20thousands%20took%20out%20parade" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./crime-news-stories-2019.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="9 Crime News Stories That Shocked Everyone In 2019">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./urban-meyer-kicked-josh-lambo-allegations.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Will Urban Meyer Be Arrested For Kicking?
