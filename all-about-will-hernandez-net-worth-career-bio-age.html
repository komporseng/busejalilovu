He is one of the two children born to Las Vegas, Nevada residents Robert Hernandez and Angelica Lemus.</p><p>He resided with his parents, who reportedly had difficulty providing for him as he grew up. Before Will was born, his family relocated from Mexico to Las Vegas.</p><p>He was influenced by Robert Hernandez, a Mexican soccer player who made a living from the game. Before finding football in the seventh grade, Will, therefore, started playing soccer.</p><p>The activities of his mother and sister, however, are not widely known.

He got to the conclusion that he wanted to play in the NFL throughout his time in high school.</p><p>Will’s family had to leave their home at that time and move into a shed they had purchased from Home Depot. Will’s grades also suffered at that point, thus the tragedy continued.</p><p>He thus began to drop out of high school and decided to commit his life to assisting his Dad with the construction business. He did a lot of different things while he was there, including delivering concrete blocks and scooping cement.</p><p>Will’s high school coaches persuaded him to return to class after learning about his predicament. Will went back to the field and immediately began working hard to improve his grade once the coaches recognized his ability.</p><h2><span id=Quick_Facts>Quick Facts</span></h2><table style=height:100%;width:100%><tbody><tr><td width=468><strong>Full Name</strong></td><td width=468>William “Will” Hernandez</td></tr><tr><td width=468><strong>Date of Birth</strong></td><td width=468>September 2, 1995</td></tr><tr><td width=468><strong>Birth Place</strong></td><td width=468>Las Vegas, Nevada</td></tr><tr><td width=468><strong>Famous Name</strong></td><td width=468><strong>Will Hernandez</strong></td></tr><tr><td width=468><strong>Religion</strong></td><td width=468>Unknown</td></tr><tr><td width=468><strong>Nationality</strong></td><td width=468>American</td></tr><tr><td width=468><strong>Ethnicity</strong></td><td width=468>Unknown</td></tr><tr><td width=468><strong>Zodiac Sign</strong></td><td width=468>Virgo</td></tr><tr><td width=468><strong>Age</strong></td><td width=468>26 Years Old (As of July 2022)</td></tr><tr><td width=468><strong>Height</strong></td><td class=infobox-data>6 feet 2 inches (1.88 meters)</td></tr><tr><td width=468><strong>Weight</strong></td><td class=infobox-data>335&nbsp;lb (152&nbsp;kg)</td></tr><tr><td width=468><strong>Hair Color</strong></td><td width=468>Black</td></tr><tr><td width=468><strong>Eye Color</strong></td><td width=468>Black</td></tr><tr><td width=468><strong>Build</strong></td><td width=468>Athletic</td></tr><tr><td width=468><strong>Father’s Name</strong></td><td width=468>Robert Hernandez</td></tr><tr><td width=468><strong>Mother’s Name</strong></td><td width=468>Angelica Lemus</td></tr><tr><td width=468><strong>Siblings</strong></td><td width=468>A younger sister named Kathy Hernandez</td></tr><tr><td width=468><strong>Education</strong></td><td width=468>Chaparral High School<br>University of Texas at El Paso&nbsp;(UTEP)</td></tr><tr><td width=468><strong>Marital Status</strong></td><td width=468>Unmarried</td></tr><tr><td width=468><strong>Girlfriend</strong></td><td width=468>None</td></tr><tr><td width=468><strong>Kids</strong></td><td width=468>None</td></tr><tr><td width=468><strong>Profession</strong></td><td width=468>Football player</td></tr><tr><td width=468><strong>Position</strong></td><td width=468>Guard</td></tr><tr><td width=468><strong>Affiliations</strong></td><td width=468><ul><li><strong><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">New York Giants&nbsp;</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Arizona Cardinals&nbsp;</a></strong></li></ul></td></tr><tr><td width=468><strong>Will Hernandez NFL Draft</strong></td><td width=468><strong>2018&nbsp;/ Round:&nbsp;2&nbsp;/ Pick:&nbsp;34</strong></td></tr><tr><td width=468><strong>Roster Status</strong></td><td width=468>Active</td></tr><tr><td width=468><strong>Net Worth</strong></td><td width=468><strong>$6 million</strong></td></tr><tr><td width=468><strong>Social Media</strong></td><td width=468><a href=# rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>Instagram</a>,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>Twitter</a></td></tr></tbody></table><h2><span id=How_tall_is_Will_Hernandez_Weight_Hair_Color>How tall is Will Hernandez?
