He’s a double amputee from the knee down and won six gold medals, one silver, and one bronze in the Paralympics from 2004 to 2012. He was the first amputee runner to compete at the Olympic Games in 2012, where his relay team finished eighth in the 4×400 meter race. He carried the South African flag at the closing ceremony.</p><p>In 2013, Pistorius shot and killed his girlfriend, Reeva Steenkamp, claiming that he had mistaken her for an intruder. He initially received a five-year sentence for culpable homicide, which was later increased to six years for murder in 2016. In November 2017, his sentence was further increased to 15 years, less time already served.</p><h2><span id=Oscar_Pistorius_Unable_to_Pay_for_Legal_Defense>Oscar Pistorius Unable to Pay for Legal Defense</span></h2><p>Oscar Pistorius’ defense lawyers claimed in October 2014 that he was unable to financially support his own legal defense. The former icon was reportedly broke and could no longer afford to pay for his legal team.</p><h2></h2><p>Oscar Pistorius was at one point earning $2 million per year from sponsorship deals with companies like Oakley, BT, and Nike. However, a week after the murder of Reeva Steenkamp, Pistorius was dropped by Nike and Oakley. Nike also pulled Pistorius’ ad featuring the line “I am the bullet in the chamber.”</p><h2><span id=Oscar_Pistorius_Early_Life_and_Education>Oscar Pistorius: Early Life and Education</span></h2><p>Oscar Pistorius was born in Johannesburg, South Africa, in 1986. He grew up with his mother, father, older brother, and younger sister in a Christian household. Pistorius was born without fibulas in both of his legs and had them amputated below the knees when he was just 11 months old. He was walking successfully with prosthetic legs within six months.</p><p>Pistorius studied at Constantia Kloof Primary School and Pretoria Boys High School, where he played rugby and participated in other sports such as tennis, water polo, and Olympic wrestling. He suffered a knee injury while playing rugby in 2003 and began running while undergoing rehab at the University of Pretoria’s High Performance Centre in 2004.</p><p>In 2006, Pistorius enrolled at the University of Pretoria to study business management with sports science.</p><h2><span id=Oscar_Pistorius_Athletic_Achievements>Oscar Pistorius’ Athletic Achievements</span></h2><p>Oscar Pistorius competed in the T44 classification despite being classified in T43. He won gold medals in the 100-metre, 200-metre, and 400-metre events at the 2006 IPC Athletics World Championships, setting disability sports world records at the 2007 South African Senior Athletics Championships and Nedbank Championships for the Physically Disabled. In 2007, the IAAF ruled that his prostheses were ineligible for competitions conducted under their rules, but Pistorius was allowed to attempt to qualify for the 2008 Summer Olympics. He won gold medals in the 100-metre, 200-metre, and 400-metre events at the 2008 Summer Paralympics. In 2011, he won three IPC Athletics World titles and achieved the “A” standard qualification mark needed to compete in the Olympic Games and World Championships. At the 2012 Summer Olympics, he became the first amputee runner to compete in the Olympics and won a silver medal in the 200-metre event, a gold medal in the 400-metre event (breaking a Paralympic record), and a team gold medal in the 4 × 100 metres relay.</p><h2><span id=Oscar_Pistorius_Career_Highlights>Oscar Pistorius’ Career Highlights</span></h2><p>In 2008, Oscar published his autobiography, “Dream Runner,” in Italian, and the English version, “Blade Runner,” was released the following year. He has appeared on the Italian versions of “Celebrity Survivor” (2010) and “Dancing with the Stars” (2012), and he was a guest on “The Tonight Show with Jay Leno” in October 2012.</p><p>In 2009, Pistorius was seriously injured in a boat accident and suffered broken bones in his face. He fully recovered after surgery, but his training and running schedules were affected by the accident.</p><p>Oscar played in the 2010 Laureus World Sports Awards Golf Challenge and the 2012 Alfred Dunhill Links Championship as well as the 2010 Help-net Fund Celebrity Charity Golf Day.</p><h2><span id=Oscar_Pistorius_Found_Guilty_of_Murder>Oscar Pistorius Found Guilty of Murder</span></h2><p>In February 2013, Oscar Pistorius, South African Paralympic runner, shot and killed his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp, claiming that he thought she was a home intruder.

In 2017, his sentence was increased to 15 years, less time already served, for murder. He will be eligible for parole in 2023.</p><h2><span id=Accolades_Received_by_Oscar_Pistorius>Accolades Received by Oscar Pistorius</span></h2><p>In 2006, South African President Thabo Mbeki awarded Pistorius the Order of Ikhamanga in Bronze (OIB), and he was given the BBC Sports Personality of the Year Helen Rollason Award in 2007, which was later revoked after his murder conviction.</p><p>Pistorius was named in “Time” magazine’s list of the world’s 100 most influential people in 2008 and 2012, and he received the Laureus World Sports Award for Sportsperson of the Year with a Disability in 2012.</p><p>A mural in Gemona, Italy, was unveiled in August 2012 that depicted Pistorius’ achievements, and he was awarded an honorary doctorate from Glasgow’s University of Strathclyde later that year, which was subsequently revoked after his 2015 conviction for culpable homicide.</p><h2>You May Also Like</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiopaG9ta3SraCcZpOkunC70pyYq2WgnsC1u9GirKxlnprBbsPOq6uhZw%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2foscar-pistorius-net-worth.html&text=Oscar%20Pistorius%20Net%20Worth%20-%20Pulptastic&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2foscar-pistorius-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2foscar-pistorius-net-worth.html&title=Oscar%20Pistorius%20Net%20Worth%20-%20Pulptastic" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2foscar-pistorius-net-worth.html&title=Oscar%20Pistorius%20Net%20Worth%20-%20Pulptastic" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2foscar-pistorius-net-worth.html&title=Oscar%20Pistorius%20Net%20Worth%20-%20Pulptastic" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2foscar-pistorius-net-worth.html&description=Oscar%20Pistorius%20Net%20Worth%20-%20Pulptastic" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./taylor-bisciotti-boyfriend-love-life-dating-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Taylor Bisciotti Boyfriend, Love Life, Dating, Net Worth">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./tobymac-wife.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Kas yra Amanda Levy McKeehan?
