His mother abandoned him when he was a baby due to a congenital ailment that caused him to be half-blind. His grandmother raised him until he was five years old when he started school. Ronnie’s favorite musical genres were country music, rhythm blues, and gospel music. His professors saw his aptitude when he was seven years old.

Ronnie’s musical idols included Little Richard, Jerry Lee Lewis, and Ray Charles.</p><p>He did so well in his studies that he was given a full college scholarship to study law at Young Harris College in Young Harris, Georgia. He continued with music while still studying, and this time he became a member of the popular R&B band Dimensions. The ensemble gained popularity in Atlanta and drew large crowds to the Royal Peacock Club. In 1964, he decided to give up law and devote his full time to the music.</p><h2><span id=Personal_Affair_Dating_Girlfriends_Wife_and_Children>Personal Affair: Dating, Girlfriends, Wife, and Children</span></h2><p>Ronnie was singing at various venues in Atlanta when he met the lovely Joyce Reeves at an evening party one night.
