If you like the volumized blowout look, consider following your usual routine and then combing your hair back into a tight high ponytail whose ends still have voluminous, loose curls. If a more relaxed look is more your speed, style your hair into a slightly messy side braid, working a bit of dry shampoo like Verb‘s into your roots and sprinkled throughout your braid for more body and grip.</description></item><item><title>Bruce Reitherman Net Worth</title><link>/bruce-reitherman-net-worth.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 12 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>youremail@domain.com (Some Person)</author><guid>/bruce-reitherman-net-worth.html</guid><description>﻿Bruce Reitherman net worth is

長く独身生活の中で、菜々緒さんなど芸能界屈指の美女との交際を重ねてきました。
そんな西川貴教さんは2020年6月に元女子アナウンサーで、現在は一般人の女性と再婚しました。
一緒にシティホテルに入って行く様が報道されたときは、すぐにポイすると思われていましたが、その後に交際を続け、無事に結婚までしました。
西川貴教さんが再婚した相手の女性がタレント兼フリーアナの伊東紗冶子さんです。
交際報道が出てすぐに、彼女の実家のお母さんがふたりの交際に対して苦言を呈しており話題になりました。
今日は西川貴教さんと現在の嫁・伊東紗冶子さんとの歴代の交際と、馴れ初め、結婚までをまとめてみたいと思います。
西川貴教と伊東紗冶子のお泊まり熱愛報道 西川貴教さんと伊東紗冶子さんは、2018年２月に写真週刊誌により交際が明るみになりました。
当時、週刊誌にはイタリア料理の名店で、美女と良い雰囲気で食事をされていた報じられ、相手の女性が伊東紗冶子さんだということは伏せられていました。
そして、そのすぐ隣をミニスカの若い美女が寄り添うように歩いていた。
『A』でお腹を満たしたら、上階にある高級スパへ――実はこれ、超一流たちの“黄金コース”なのである。西川と美女が入ったのは、カップルに人気の完全個室のスパだった。
スパを終えたのは深夜1時前。
まず一人で姿を現した西川はしきりに周囲をチェック。
安全が確認されたのか、まずは美女一人を店から出して、迎車のタクシーに乗り込ませた。
タクシーはそのまま都内の高級ホテルへ。その後、西川を乗せたタクシーも彼女が待つ高級ホテルへ。引用元：https://headlines.yahoo.co.jp/
西川貴教さんと彼女は周囲に気を使いながら、時間差でホテルで合流したとされています。
高身長の美女を高級料理、高級スパ、高級ホテルに美女を連れ込んだとか、当時のファンの印象はあまり良くなかったです。
実は西川貴教さんは2018年に伊東紗冶子さんと熱愛報道が出る手前、大学生の女の子をポイしたという週刊誌の記事出ており、この時期の西川貴教さんの女遊びに関しては世間の目は厳しかったのです。
西川貴教が女子大学生をポイ捨てしていた？ 西川さんは伊東さんとのデート報道が出る少し前にはモデル系の大学生をポイ捨てしたという内容の記事が出ました。
内容は、実際にポイ捨てされた女子大生自らが週刊誌に密告してるという形で、かなりリアリティありました。
その後、自宅デートを重ねたが、西川から「つきあおう」という言葉はなかった。1月中旬のある夜、いつも通り自宅に招かれたA子さんは、西川にこう聞いた。
「私たち、体だけの関係じゃないんだよね？」
西川の答えは、真剣そのものだった。
「“なんでそんな悲しいこと言うの！大切だし、一緒にいたいと思ってるよ！”って。彼の言葉に安心したし、信じていいんだなと」（A子さん）
だがこの日以降、ふたりの関係は急変する。LINEが、一切返ってこなくなったのだ。
「全て既読スルーです。何か不快にさせてしまったのならごめんなさい、と謝罪の文面も送りましたが、返事は来ません。真面目な交際なのか念を押したことで、重くなったのでしょうか。怒りさえわかず、ただただ、悲しみだけが募りました」（A子さん）引用元：https://www.news-postseven.com
この報道の直後に伊東さんとのお泊まり報道が出たという事で、当時は「どうせ一晩だけの女だろ」というネガティブな反応が多数だったのです。
ちなみに、この報道に誰よりも怒りの反応をみせたのが、なんと伊東紗冶子さんの母親でありました。
実は伊東紗冶子さんの母は会社を経営してるカリスマ性溢れる人物。
本気で怒らせたらダメな人だったのです！
西川貴教が伊東紗冶子の母（質屋会社経営）にブログやFacebookでディスられる？ 伊東紗冶子さんの母親は熱愛報道が出た当初、西川貴教さんに対しブログやFacebookで痛烈批判をしていたことでも有名です。
実家は大阪で江戸時代から続く老舗の「セブンマルイ質屋」という質屋さんです。
由緒ある老舗の末えいなのです。
そして父親も「和食さと」を経営する「サトレトランシステムグループ」の顧問を務めている超エリート階級の方です。
伊東紗冶子さんの母親は、娘である伊東紗冶子さんと西川貴教さんの熱愛報道に激怒し、当時ブログやFacebookで怒りをあらわにして話題となりました。

お騒がせしてごめんなさい
2018.02.24
今朝からたくさんのご心配やお叱りのご連絡を受けました。
私の次女紗冶子がこのような騒動を起こし大変ご心配ご迷惑おかけしました。
伊東家始まって以来の恥さらしで先祖に対して申し訳ないです。
しかもまったくリッチじゃない、、、シティーホテル(笑)情けない。
だいたいこの相手の方、どこの誰だか私は全く知りません。
一言の詫びも挨拶もこの雑誌が出た今でさえ一切ありません。
社会人として終わっています。
しかしわがこがこのような不始末を起こすのは何か
今のお仕事に疲れたのだと思います。
誰でも就職して数年目で壁には当たりますが自力で解決しないと
だめだとと思います。
男性と交際することで逃げたとしてもそれは一時しのぎでしかないです。
またそんなスキきのある女性に相談に乗るのではなく肉体関係だけ目的
で近づくとはええ社会人のすることではないですね。
非常に残念です。
人生は色々なことがありますね。
困った時こそリヨコを思い出してください。
査定ルームより愛をこめて
本日も永井リヨコがお待ち申し上げております

皆様お騒がせして申し訳ありません。本人はお食事しただけと申しておりますが、李下に冠を正さずです。
このTMとか言う方なにをしてる方かさっぱり存じ上げませんがかなりご年配ですね。
大人ならこんな騒動にならないよう注意してもしいものです。
見た目も意識も低いようで、、
見た目から行動から、西川さんのすべてを批判してるように見えます。
ちなみに、このお母さんの怒りのコメントは、当時はメディアにも大きく報じられていました。</description></item><item><title>Armani Jackson- Wiki, Age, Height, Net Worth, Career</title><link>/armani-jackson.html</link><pubDate>Sun, 11 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>youremail@domain.com (Some Person)</author><guid>/armani-jackson.html</guid><description>Armani Jackson is an American singer, actor, model, social media personality, online celebrity, television personality, and famous family member from Madison, Wisconsin.
