The headless horseman is said to be the ghost of a Hessian soldier who was decapitated during the Revolutionary War. According to the legend, he roams the woods at night, seeking his missing head. Crane employs forensic methods while investigating, and this clashes with the supernatural beliefs of the villagers.</p><p>Sleepy Hollow was a critical and commercial success.

In the end, Crane is killed by the Headless Horseman, but Katrina survives.</p><p>Ricci won two awards for her performance in the role.
