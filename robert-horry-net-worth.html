During his tenure he won seven championships with three different teams, the most of any player not included in the 1960s Boston Celtics run. His efforts have helped raise his net worth to where it is now.</p><p>How rich is Robert Horry? As of early-2016, sources estimate that his net worth is at $20 million, mostly earned through a successful career in basketball. His records and skills at the game earned him high valued contracts which helped boost his wealth significantly. Currently, he works as a sports commentator for Time Warner Cable SportsNet.</p><h3>Robert Horry Net Worth $20 Million</h3><p>Robert started his basketball career playing at Andalusia High School where in his senior year he would become Naismith Alabama High School Player of the Year. He was given a basketball scholarship by the University of Alabama, where he attended and played basketball, and during his time there, the team won three SEC tournament titles and compiled a 98-36 record. He also set the school record for blocked shots at 282.</p><p>Robert joined the 1992 NBA Draft and was selected as the 11th overall pick by the Houston Rockets. He played his first four seasons with the Rockets, helping the team earn two championships during 1994 and 1995, and setting an NBA Finals record for most steals in a game at seven. In 1994, he was set to be traded to the Detroit Pistons but the trade was rescinded. According to Horry, those events saved his career as he started earning recognition as a clutch shooter, especially in game-winning scenarios. This was a strong start to his net worth.</p><p>In 1996 Robert was traded to the Phoenix Suns, where he played for a season but was suspended and eventually traded to the Los Angeles Lakers. He continued to play for the Lakers, more of a bench player than as a starter, but he helped the team reach their championship win during 2000, including Horry’s finals-high 17 points. The following season, Robert continued to make big plays especially during the playoffs, and the team won against the Philadelphia 76ers in five games to win their second straight championship. One of the most recognizable clutch plays by Horry would be in the following season at the Conference Finals against the Sacramento Kings. The Lakers were down 2 to 1 in games and were trailing 99-97 with around 11 seconds to play. After a few failed layups, the ball was swatted directly at Horry’s direction which led him to score a game winning three pointer. The Lakers would eventually defeat the Kings and later the Nets in the finals with a 4-0 sweep.</p><p>During 2003, Robert became a free agent and was concerned about being too far away from his family, so he signed with the San Antonio Spurs, who cut his minutes significantly and resulted in better play. The Spurs would reach the 2004 playoffs where they defeated the Memphis Grizzlies but lost to the Los Angeles Lakers in six games. The following year they would reach the finals, and Robert would prove true to his skills again as he scored 21 points during the fourth quarter and overtime in Game 5, even scoring the game winning three-point basket. His final championship would be won at 2007, still with the Spurs.</p><p>For his personal life, Robert was married to Keva and had two children. His first child was diagnosed with 1p36 deletion syndrome that resulted in her early death during 2011 at the age of 17. He currently lives with his family in Houston.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=14.064322469983><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Robert Horry</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$20 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>August 25, 1970</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Harford County, Maryland USA</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>2.06</td></tr><tr><td>Weight</td><td>108.86</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Profession</td><td>Retired Basketball Player, Sports Commentator</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Education</td><td>Andalusia High School, University of Alabama</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Spouse</td><td>Keva Develle (m. 1997–2011)</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Children</td><td>Jade Horry, Ashlyn Horry, Cameron Horry</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Parents</td><td>Leila Horry, Robert Horry Sr.</td></tr><tr readability=0.41176470588235><td>Twitter</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://twitter.com/rkhorry</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.25806451612903><td>IMDB</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>www.imdb.com/name/nm1608909</a></td></tr><tr readability=9><td>Awards</td><td>Naismith Alabama High School Player of the Year, NBA champion (1994, 1995, 2000–2002, 2005, 2007), NBA All-Rookie Second Team (1993)</td></tr></table><table class=trademarks readability=1><tr><th>#</th><th>Trademark</th></tr><tr readability=2><td>1</td><td>Known for hitting clutch 3-pointers</td></tr></table><table class=interesting_facts readability=10.327611940299><tr><th>#</th><th>Fact</th></tr><tr readability=2><td>1</td><td>Appeared in a commercial for "1-800-Lawyers".
